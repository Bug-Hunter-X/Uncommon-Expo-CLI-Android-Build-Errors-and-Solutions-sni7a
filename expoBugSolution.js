The solutions to these uncommon errors are highly context-dependent, as the underlying cause varies.  

Here's a strategy:

1. **Precise Error Message:** Carefully examine the full error message from the Expo CLI build output.  Identify the specific error code or description. 
2. **Google Search:**  Use the precise error message as a search query. Stack Overflow and other forums often contain solutions to specific Gradle or Android build errors.
3. **Check Expo Documentation:** Look for known issues or troubleshooting steps in the official Expo documentation for Android builds.
4. **Community Forums:** Post your question on Expo community forums, providing detailed information about your error, project setup (including any relevant packages), and your Android environment configuration.
